- **IoT Compatibility**: Designed for seamless integration into IoT ecosystems.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces power consumption by optimizing fan usage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an interactive front-end for monitoring and control.

 Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**: 
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Flask
- **Frameworks**: Flask (for backend development)
- **Front-End**: HTML
