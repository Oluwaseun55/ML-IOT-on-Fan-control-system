# ML-IoT Fan Control System

## Overview
The **ML-IoT Fan Control System** is a cutting-edge project that combines Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to optimize fan speed control. By analyzing environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, the system predicts and adjusts fan speed in real-time, ensuring maximum energy efficiency and enhanced user comfort.

## Features
- **Smart Fan Control**: Dynamically adjusts fan speed based on real-time data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements predictive ML algorithms for accurate environmental analysis.
- **IoT Integration**: Compatible with IoT systems for seamless operation.
- **Energy Optimization**: Reduces energy consumption through intelligent control.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive front-end for monitoring and managing the fan.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Flask
  - Matplotlib
- **Framework**: Flask (backend)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS

## Project Structure
- **`Ml_For_IOT_Controls.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing ML model development, training, and testing.
- **`app.py`**: Flask application file for API endpoints and backend functionality.
- **`index.html`**: Frontend HTML file for the web interface.
- **`requirement.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- **`run.py`**: Script to start the application.

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oluwaseun55/ML-IOT-on-Fan-control-system.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ML-IOT-on-Fan-control-system
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

5. **Access the Web Interface**:
   Open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## How It Works
1. Input real-time environmental data, such as temperature and humidity, into the system.
2. The ML model processes the data and predicts the optimal fan speed.
3. The predicted speed is sent to the fan control system via the IoT framework.
4. The interactive interface allows users to monitor and manually adjust settings if needed.

## Use Cases
- **Home Automation**: Enhance comfort and save energy in smart homes.
- **Industrial Applications**: Optimize cooling systems in factories or server rooms.
- **Energy Conservation**: Reduce electricity bills through intelligent fan control.
